# TBC-project
<br>

#### Introduction
The project is an interactive game where 5 random cards are dealt to 3 players from 4 decks. Players have the opportunity to exchange one card. Scores are based on card values, colors and card frequency. The game continues until only one player remains.

#### Planning
- Create classes for Player and Card
- Create functions and methods that will handle:
    - User inputs
    - Creating decks
    - Dealing, showing and changing cards
    - Comparing scores and getting final results
    - Main function will control the flow of the program by directing calls to other functions and methods


#### Steps to follow
go to ` main.py ` file and run the program
